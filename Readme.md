-   Project OpaNoid is an teen to adult-sized humanoid robot designed
    for education and research. It is highly modular
    and can be modified on the fly using only simple tools such as hex-head
    screwdrivers.

-   Its chassis has been designed to be completely printed with using FDM
    3D printing (the most accessible 3D printing technique at present)

-   By focusing on the humanoid form, greater attention can be paid to the key
    objectives of Project Opanoid; namely its variable mass distribution,
    variable dimensions, scalability (servos can be stacked to support higher
    torque requirements) and expandability (add-ons such as sensors can be added
    without modification to the core structure through the use of
    rail-mountings)

**Current Progress **

-   At present, version 1.0 of the lower body and CAD work for the upper body
    has been completed. The community is take part in the finalisation of
    version 1.0 of the upper body.
