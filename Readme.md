#Project OpaNoid

-   Project OpaNoid is an teen to adult-sized humanoid robot designed
    for education and research. It is highly modular
    and can be modified on the fly using only simple tools such as hex-head
    screwdrivers.

-   Its chassis has been designed to be completely printed with using FDM
    3D printing (the most accessible 3D printing technique at present)

-   By focusing on the humanoid form, greater attention can be paid to the key
    objectives of Project Opanoid; namely its variable mass distribution,
    variable dimensions, scalability (servos can be stacked to support higher
    torque requirements) and expandability (add-ons such as sensors can be added
    without modification to the core structure through the use of
    rail-mountings)
